## What is WhatTheFridge?
WhatTheFridge is an app that makes grocery shopping easy. Users log-in and see all of their recipes on the dashboard with an estimate of how much that meal will cost. After a user chooses which dishes they will be cooking that week, whatthefridge looks inside that user's "fridge" and generates a customized list of exactly which ingredients they'll need to buy on their next shopping trip and in what quantity.
